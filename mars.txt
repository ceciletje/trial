These are my notes about Mars:
Cold and dry but nicely coloured.

And now I can think of what to add next.
The two moons look interesting.

It lacks humidity.

This planet hasn't got any green stuff anywhere.

I don't want biscuit lovers to eat the whole planet, but we should
welcome tourists.  What shall we do?
